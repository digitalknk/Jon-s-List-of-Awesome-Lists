# Jon's List of Awesome Lists
---

Just my own collection of *"Awesome Lists"* that I want to follow but don't want to star since I am trying to keep up my stars. I have no plans to add my list to another awesome list, it does not compliy by [The awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md).

Suggestions and contributions are always welcome.
